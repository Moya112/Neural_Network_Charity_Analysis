# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Project Overview
For this project, we will help Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization that raises funds for charities, to analyze which organizations are worth donating to, review their history and which were successful in the past. We started from a CSV database with all the organizations that received funds from Alphabet soup over the years, and we will develop a Deep Learning Neural Network Model using the Python TensorFlow library. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
